"""
Release the MDK.

The process:

0. Ensure current checkout is not dirty (i.e. everything is committed).
1. Ensure current commit has passing tests by talking to Travis API.
2. Bump versions on all relevant files using the bumpversion tool.

(TODO: once we only have `master` branch and no more `develop` will add more
steps:

3. Git commit. Can be done via bumpversion.
4. Tag with new version. Can be done via bumpversion.
5. Tell user command to run to git push and actually release the code.)

For now however we will continue current process. I.e. local commit will need to
be pushed to branch on GitHub, that branch will be merged to `develop` with PR,
and `develop` merged to `master` with PR and then tag that release.

(TODO: There will also be infrastructure in the CI system to automatically upload
Python/Ruby/JS/Java packages on tagged commits.)


Usage:
  release.py patch
  release.py minor

Commands:
  patch      Bump the version's patch level, e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
  minor      Bump the version's minor level, e.g. 1.0.2 -> 1.1.0

Version numbers have been incremented. You should now:

1. Inspect the changes in the branch.
2. git add all changed files.
3. git commit.
4. git push to GitHub.
5. Open a PR into `develop`.
5. Merge PR into `develop` when tests pass.
6. Merge `develop` into `master`.
7. Create a release using the GitHub UI.

These steps will be automated in future iterations of the release automation.
